# NetCoreFx (.Net Core Framework Extensions)

This project is a library of .Net Core framework extensions.

As a result of creating a number of .Net Core projects on Github, a common project has emerged that is essentially a library of very specific extensions to the .Net Core framework. The name of the aforementioned project is simply called _'FX (Framework Extensions)'_. Because I am duplicating this project across different Github projects, I decided to extract _FX_ into it's very own Github repository. There must be tons of projects out there that do something similar. However, my intention for this project is not to become a project that is adopted by the mainstream. Instead, I want to use this project as an example of creating a very simple library and publishing it to _[Nuget]_. I will be using this project as a dependency for most/all of the .NetCore projects that I contribute.
